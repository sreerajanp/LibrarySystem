# Library Management System

   Library System is a microservice-based app that helps library staff manage books, borrowers, and loans easily. The services talk to each other using gRPC for fast and efficient communication, while WebAPI endpoints let users access the system. This setup helps to support smart library decisions.

 Flow Description

    1. API Layer ‚Äì Handles HTTP requests from clients and converts them into gRPC calls.
    2. gRPC Service Layer ‚Äì Contains core business logic, processes requests, and queries the database.
    3. Shared Database ‚Äì SQLite database used by all services for consistent data access.

```
## Technologies Used
    ‚úîÔ∏è C# and .NET 9: Primary language and framework for all projects.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è gRPC (Grpc.AspNetCore): For internal microservice communication.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Entity Framework Core 9 (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design): ORM for data access and migrations.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è SQLite: Database engine for persistent storage.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è xUnit (xunit, xunit.runner.visualstudio): Unit and integration testing framework.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Moq: Mocking library for tests.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è coverlet.collector: Code coverage tool for tests.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk: Test runner for .NET projects.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Swagger: For API documentation (implied by documentation, check for Swashbuckle or similar in API project).  
    ‚úîÔ∏è HttpClient: For HTTP interactions.  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Postman: For API testing (external tool).  
    ‚úîÔ∏è Microservice Architecture: Modular design with separate services for Book, User, and Borrower.  
 
 ## Assumptions
    - The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features or services.
    - Each service is independent and can be deployed separately.
    - The database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of the library system.
    - The API endpoints are designed to be intuitive and follow RESTful principles.
    - The division between endpoints and gRPC services was made based on our own design choices to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities.
    - The logic and calculations rely on certain assumptions, like estimating reading speed using the borrow and return timestamps.

 ## Get the code from GitHub

    üëâ Clone or download the project repository.
    üëâ Open the solution file `LibrarySystem.sln` using **Visual Studio 2022**.
    üëâ Ensure you have the required .NET SDK installed (version 9.0 or higher).

  ## How to run the project

    üëâ Build the solution and explore the project structure and source code.
    üëâ Set up the multiple startup project in solution properties to `Library.Book.Service, Library.User.Service, Library.Borrower.Service, Library.Web.Api`.
    üëâ Run the solution to start the gRPC services and API.
    üëâ Use Swagger/Postman/HTTP client(Library.Web.Api.http) to interact with the API endpoints.
    üëâ Optionally, you can run the included test projects to validate the functionality.
    üëâ For database migrations, use the provided EF Core commands to create and seed the database.
    üëâ To run the tests, use the provided commands to execute unit and integration tests.
    üëâ Refer to the architecture diagram and project structure for a better understanding of the system.
    üëâ Run the included test projects for validation.

   ## How to start the service using Command Line

        ```
        gRPC Service: Navigate to respective project path Library.Book.Service, Library.User.Service, Library.Borrower.Service and run the following commands:
            dotnet clean
            dotnet build
            dotnet run

        Web API: Navigate to respective project path Library.Web.API and run the following commands:

            cd Library.Web.API
            dotnet clean
            dotnet build
            dotnet run
        ```

## Test the API using HttpClient

- Open the **`Library.Web.API`** project in Visual Studio.
- Locate and open the `Library.Web.Api.http` file.
- Send HTTP requests to test the endpoints using the built-in HTTP file support or use Postman.
